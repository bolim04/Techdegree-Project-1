Welcome to my first Team Treehouse Full Stack Web Developer Techdegree Project!
Title of project: A random quote generator.
This webpage shows a random quote, and gives you the option to show another quote if the 'Show another quote' button is clicked.

The code includes an array or 5 objects that include values for the properties 'quote' and 'source'.
One of the objects had to include the properties 'citation' and 'year'.

A function named 'getRandomQuote' randomized the quote objects and returns one when when called.

A function named 'printQuote' uses the 'getRandomQuote' function to write the random returned quote to the webpage.
In this function, the HTML string was added onto using template literals. The quote and source was added for every quote object.
Using 'if' statememts, the HTML string was added onto using template literals again if the quote object contained a citation or year property.

The function 'printQuote' is called to show the random quote object in the webpage with the associated properties.

The 'printQuote' function will run again, if the 'Show another quote' is clicked in the webpage.
